# Stixex

An implementation of CTI's STIX data format, as defined by http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.0/

This video response directed at everyone who "designed" this spec: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2oCV2sM\_ig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2oCV2sM_ig)

>Why are we still here? Just to suffer?
>Every night, I feel my coherent data formats, and my naming conventions... even my json
>The sanity I've lost, the trust in committees I've lost
>It won't stop hurting
>It's like they're all still there
>You feel it too, don't you?
>I'm gonna make them give back our formats
